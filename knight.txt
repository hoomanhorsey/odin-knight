***Knight moves***

+2 in any direction. Then +1 but only to the left or right of direction it travelled from.


If knights position is (x,y), then a legal move is any of the following:

East
(x+2, y+1)
(x+2, y-1)

West
(x-2, y+1)
(x-2, y-1)

North
(y+2, x+1)
(y+2, x-1)

South
(y-2, x+1)
(y-2, x-1)


***Knight Moves - Legal***

The board consists of a matrix 8 x 8, [0-7]

Basically you will need to create a function that checks if the move is legal, isLegal(). 
This function:
1 - calculates the starting position of the knight.
2 - And then calculates all the permiited moves of the knight from above. 
    For example, if the starting position is [0,0], then the (x+2, y-1) move is not legal as it moves it below the board
    However, the (x+2, y+1) is as it takes the position from [0,0] to [2,1]



*** Creating the board***

Can I create the board by going through each position [0,0] through to [7,7] and then creating an array for each position 
which is filled with only those moves that are legal, using a function that only adds legal moves to the array?
